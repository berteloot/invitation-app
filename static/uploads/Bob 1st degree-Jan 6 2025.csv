It wasn't born out of a need for business or money. It was born from a passion for education and a dream to revolutionize IT training.Picture this:A small team with big dreams, working day and night. Our mission? To make learning technology accessible, engaging, and empowering. SAP, Workday, DevOps, SalesForce, DataScience, AI, Cybersecurity – we wanted to make these not just subjects, but pathways to growth and opportunity.But, here's a reality check:The journey was tough. In an ocean of Edtech startups, how do you stand out? How do you convince the world that what you have is special?Here's what we did:We focused on stories. Not just any stories, but stories of transformation. Every student who walked through our virtual doors had a story – a journey of growth, of overcoming challenges, of achieving dreams. And these stories became the heart of ZaranTech.We embraced social media. LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube – these weren't just platforms; they were our stages to connect, share, and grow. We shared our students' success stories, our insights on technology, our vision for the future of education.Now, let's talk about growth:From a few local clients to over 300 worldwide, the growth was exponential. But it wasn't just about numbers. It was about impact. Over 30,000 students trained – each number representing a life empowered, a career transformed.And me?I grew alongside ZaranTech. From a founder to a leader, a visionary. I learned that leading an Edtech company wasn't just about imparting knowledge; it was about inspiring change, fostering a community, and driving innovation.But wait, there's more:Every challenge was a lesson. From increasing our hashtag#linkedin presence to generating more leads, each hurdle pushed us to innovate, to think creatively, and to stay ahead of the curve.And here we are:In 2024, ZaranTech stands not just as a company, but as a beacon of empowerment and growth in the hashtag#edtech space. We're not just teaching IT skills; we're shaping futures, and building a community of tech enthusiasts and professionals who are ready to take on the world.So, what's the takeaway?Your passion can be the spark that lights up a thousand lives. Share it, nurture it, and watch it transform the world. And always remember, every big dream begins with a simple belief – a belief in yourself and your vision.","Workday training, sap training, Salesforce Training, Devops training, Cloud computing training, Workday Integration, Workday Human Capital Management, Workday, SAP HANA, SAP ERP, SAP Products, SAP, Business Analysis, Business Objects, Requirements Analysis, SDLC, Visio, Business Process, Project Management, Vendor Management, Business Requirements, PMP, Business Process Improvement, Software Documentation, Business Intelligence, Training, ERP, Consulting, IT Strategy, Testing, SharePoint, SQL, SAP R/3, Oracle, Databases",Farmers Insurance,https://linkedin.com/company/3240,3240,Sr. Business System Analyst,Mar 2004 - Dec 2008,"West Des Moines, Iowa, United States · On-site","- Led the analysis and implementation of a new underwriting system, resulting in a 15% increase in efficiency and a 20% decrease in errors.- Developed and maintained financial models to provide insight into business performance and assist in forecasting and budgeting.- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to identify and implement process improvements, resulting in a 25% reduction in policy issuance time.- Conducted data analysis to identify trends and opportunities for cost savings and revenue growth.- Acted as a subject matter expert in providing support and training to business users on the use of the new underwriting system.- Developed and presented regular performance reports to senior management.",Andhra University,https://www.linkedin.com/school/9615393,9615393,"BE, Mechanical Engineering",1990 - 1994,Bachelors in Engineering,Kendriya Vidyalaya,https://www.linkedin.com/school/15106896,15106896,"12th Grade, Math, Science, English",1988 - 1990,10 + 2,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAEAg3EBmjvU3NczVy7RwchHjUh8NCO_Z88%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,alokkumar4,,1934357,16810865,ACoAAAEAg3EBmjvU3NczVy7RwchHjUh8NCO_Z88,No,No,8226857766759958,1st,9/11/24,12/19/24,Deleted Phantom (3449607594918610),[Deleted Phantom] (undefined)

Blogger, speaker, thinker.CEO of Resulting IT, Trustee of Warrington Wolves Community Foundation.",Warrington,,,,,,Mr,,,"Fundamentally, what I do best is help people create clarity when things are complex and help them think differently when they’re facing big challenges.  I've spent much of my career seeking variety and ensuring that my talents are not wasted - my profile reflects this. My main professional background has been in IT Services - software development, product management and implementation of large ERP systems such as SAP.  The majority of my 'career' has focused on the set up of new IT services capabilities, SAP Centres for Excellence, outsourcing, offshore delivery and the design of IT organsiations. The results I get typically equate to greater performance, reduced costs, better service and greater alignment of IT with business strategy.Fortunately, I made a decision during my career not to focus on just one thing.  I did this to provide variety and make sure that my career didn't overtake my life. Working to my values and not missing my children growing up were two factors that led to me build a portfolio career - ultimately creating a way of working that many people talk about but rarely achieve.In 2006, I published 'How to be exceptional' - a personal development book designed to make people more exceptional at whatever they do - people who've read it tell me that it has helped them to improve their work, lives and generally become better at what they do and feel better about the way they do it. My company, Resulting is a consulting business - we help people get results.  Part of our focus is to help large companies deal with big IT challenges.  Part of our focus is working with interesting people with business challenges who simply need help to think clearly and differently.","Fundraising, Brand Awareness, Health & Wellness, Partner Relationship Management, Strategy, Consulting, Business Transformation, Marketing Strategy, Pre-sales, Content Marketing, Inbound Marketing, SAP, IT Strategy, Outsourcing, Service Delivery, IT Service Management, ERP, Business Process, Enterprise Software, NLP",Warrington Wolves Community Foundation,https://linkedin.com/company/2820331,2820331,Board Trustee,09/2022 - Present,"Warrington, England, United Kingdom","I'm proud to be associated with this groundbreaking local charity which is close to my heart and values.

In 1989, he graduated as an industrial engineer at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

I really loved this. Basically, I still do the same thing today. Ok, the companies became a bit bigger. And the technology more complex. Now, the potential is almost endless. During the last 20+ years at SAP and in the SAP ecosystem I learned how to best leverage business software and technology for larger companies and to ensure tangible business outcomes. And how to make sure that the users have a great experience and productive tools to get their work done.Some of my favorite topics are HR Tech and the Digital Workplaces.If you would like to connect just send me a message on LinkedIn or use my email-adress: michael.kern@sovanta.com.

Integrating AI into businesses to deliver enterprise value, as an example, is not so much about the algorithms: it requires understanding companies’ operations, decision processes, core business processes across industries, as well as enterprise architecture and technology platforms that provide real-time, high-quality data to feed AI models and deliver on clear business use cases.","Sustainability Transformation, Program Coordination, Digital Platforms for Knowledge Sharing, Environmental Advocacy, Sustainability Best Practices, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), Stakeholder Management, Public Speaking, Event Planning and Management, Network Expansion, Partnership Development, Community Engagement, Innovative Training Design, Collaborative Learning, Cross-sector Collaboration, Peer-Driven Learning, Knowledge Amplification, Pro Bono Program Management, 1.Sustainability Transformation 2.Collaborative Learning 3.Pro Bono Program Management 4.Knowledge Amplification 5.Peer-Driven Learning 6.Cross-Sector Collaboration 7.Innovative Training Design 8.Community Engagement 9.Partnership Development 10.Network Expansion 11.Sustainability Strategy 12.Event Planning and Management 13.Public Speaking 14.Stakeholder Management 15.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 16.Sustainability Best Practices 17.Environmental Advocacy 18.Digital Platforms for Knowledge Sharing 19.Program Coordination 20.Strategic Planning, Community Development",SAP,https://linkedin.com/company/1115,1115,"Regional Vice President, Head of Industries at SAP EMEA North",04/2020 - 04/2022,,"Led a team of industry leaders and advisors, serving as a trusted C-level advisors.Ensured 4X pipeline coverage, secured major opportunities (some beyond €100M TCV), and achieved >200% YoY growth in Industry Cloud.",NEOMA Business School,https://www.linkedin.com/school/3330082,3330082,MBA,01/1991 - 01/1994,NEOMA is the result of the merger of Rouen and Reims Business Schools,The University of Dallas,https://www.linkedin.com/school/11664,11664,MBA,01/1993 - 01/1993,,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAA1SQ8BVVwZeyBAvfON2Pvqt3R1aAZvrD4%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,davidmarchesseau,,1115,3492111,ACoAAAA1SQ8BVVwZeyBAvfON2Pvqt3R1aAZvrD4,,,6691087485136457,1st,9/11/24,10/25/24,Deleted Phantom (3449607594918610),Bob recent connections

Time flies!For more than 20 years already, I have been working for SAP in consulting, pre-sales, product management, business development and alliances or partnership roles. In all of them, I have supported customers and partners getting the most out of their relationship with my company. Value creation and collaboration!Due to the nature of our global economy and our many customers and ecosystem partners, I have the ability to work in many countries and interact with people from many cultural and professional backgrounds both internally and externally. With this experience as well as my prior industrial background, I have a broad industry, business process and technology knowledge.Since April 2022, I lead our industry partner management team and have the ability to cover a broad field of partner activities across all industry verticals that SAP serves with our line of business and industry-specific solutions. Earlier I focused on Energy and Natural Resources includes Chemicals, Mill Products & Mining, Oil, Gas & Energy, and Utilities. But now this larger variety in industries allows me to work with many different and highly experienced teams, working on numerous topics from strategy and ideation to monetization and go-to-market. At the moment, I am managing 20 industry domain and partnering experts as part of my direct managerial responsibilities. I am driven by helping partners become more efficient and successful in their relationship with SAP and in the end with our mutual end-customers. This is what I can use my creativity, knowledge and experience for. This is how I like to spend my day, because it involves different topics and various skills. In my life outside work, I like to travel and spend time with family, sports, movies, music and arts in general. And I am engaged in voluntary work at a golf club, where I am acting as the youth coordinator and serve as a member of the board.","Strategic Alliances, Business Process Design, Consulting, Custom Software, Product Marketing, Talent Management, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Business Development, Management, Strategy, Coaching, Cloud Computing, Partner Management, Leadership, Go-to-market Strategy, SAP, Machine learning, SaaS, BPO, Outsourcing",SAP,https://linkedin.com/company/1115,1115,Global Vice President and Head of Ecosystem for Energy and Natural Resources Industries,08/2013 - 07/2022,"Walldorf, Germany","Identify and Monetize Co-Innovation, Co-Development and Go-to-Market opportunities with existing and new partners for the industries in the Energy and Natural Resources sector (Chemicals, Utilities, Mill Products and Mining, Oil and Gas)",Mannheim Business School,https://www.linkedin.com/school/1118146,1118146,Master of Business Administration,04/2008 - 11/2009,"General Management, Leadership, Strategy",The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth,https://www.linkedin.com/school/716453,716453,,01/2020 - 01/2020,"Online program completed in October 2020 focusing on reimagine tomorrow's enterprise, today.

The great force that unleashes my outstanding creativity and makes me set off again and again for new shores. Mine is marketing and communications, both fields in which I have been successful for over two decades. I started my career by studying Business Engineering at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences and have been working for SAP SE since my graduation in 1997, starting within development, where I was responsible for building up and leading the central test organization as well as for marketing activities at SAP Hosting. Further stations have been in strategic development, and Active Global Support being first in charge of global product management of SAP’s Premium Engagement Program including services such as SAP MaxAttention followed by my function as Director Business Development for the region Latin America. Later I moved to Singapore in the same role taking over responsibility for Asia Pacific. In that role, it was my job to drive SAP’s support offerings within the indirect channel to success.Now, as VP and Global Head Marketing and External Communications for Services and Support at SAP SE, I lead a global team with the responsibility to create marketing content of all kinds (print/digital/video) as well as customer references (written/video), the external and internal distribution of marketing content via central platforms, communications (press releases/newsbytes) and social media (blogs/posts/videos/podcasts), the execution of own events, as well as integrating into existing key events, to raise awareness and generate demand for Services and Support from SAP.I am also member of the JCI and of the association of professional journalists in Germany (DFJV).As a Business Development professional, I am particularly characterized by a deep understanding of complex products and services, the ability to distill messaging for purposes of selling, marketing, training, positioning. I am recognized for the creation of unique sales assets (from complex descriptions to easy-to-understand) and requested by several departments.

Here’s some background information about me and what I do…I founded my firm iMind Transformation after decades of implementing leading edge technologies in multinational and government organizations {1984 to 2004].  As a leader, consultant, and trusted advisor in organizational restructure, IT governance capability maturity, initiative management and digital transformation [2004 to 2010], I was witnessing that common strategic planning, and change and program management practices were increasingly ineffective in addressing the unique but universal characteristics of post-millennium change…particularly for the (shrinking) time and money available.Up until 2010, my goal had been to address gaps in approach and success strategies between business and information technology so that business objectives could be met – and using a blend of practices in business architecting, organizational change management and initiative management practices. With the decades of experience implementing leading edge technology and practices in hand I began to research and develop a methodology to directly act upon and accelerate the human, governance, organizational and initiative management factors in business transformation [2010 to 2015]. Having been hands on in the emergence of client-server and new waves of network architectures, in the emergence and norming of continuous process improvement, and in the expansion into data warehousing and business intelligence, it seemed inevitable that continuous transformation would soon be a demand upon business and the ability to do it well a critical success mechanism. The ability to transform with speed in high-ambiguity contexts that were increasing in complexity became a focus of my work.The Continuous Transformation Management Framework was born alongside a well-defined paradigm and capability model for being/becoming a continuously transforming organization (the Transformational Organization Paradigm). It is the only methodology and suite of practices specifically designed for managing continuous transformation.At this time, I am one of a few professionals in North America who has equal mastery in information technology and transformational organization change. I advise and consult to organizations across Canada and Europe to leverage the success of their new and ongoing transformation.I publish books and toolkits regularly and speak on the subject of business transformation and the organizational, behavioral, technology, values and mindset shifts associated with it.","Business Architecture, Digital Transformation, Communication, Strategic Communications, Strategic Partnerships, Enterprise Architecture, Digital Strategy, Management Consulting, Business Transformation, Change Management, Strategic Planning, Program Management, Organizational Change, PMO, IT Strategy, Project Management, Outsourcing, Business Process, Business Strategy, Strategy",iMind Transformation Global,https://linkedin.com/company/2930543,2930543,Researcher & Author,11/2008 - Present,,"Conduct research supporting a new business paradigm ""Transformational Organization Paradigm"" and associated methodology ""Continuous Transformation Management Framework"".
